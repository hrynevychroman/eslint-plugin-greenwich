# ESLint Rule: no-single-word-imports

## Description

Hello everyone, This ESLint rule enforces naming conventions for imports of single-word identifiers within specific directories. It is part of the [eslint-plugin-greenwich](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-greenwich) plugin.

The rule checks that single-word import names do not violate specified naming conventions in certain directory paths. In this rule's context, a "single-word import" refers to an import statement that imports a default export with a single-word identifier.

## Installation

To use this rule in your ESLint configuration, you can install the [eslint-plugin-greenwich](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-greenwich) plugin using your preferred package manager.

1. **Using pnpm:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install eslint-plugin-greenwich --save-dev
   ```

2. **Using npm:**

   ```bash
   npm install eslint-plugin-greenwich --save-dev
   ```

3. **Using yarn:**

   ```bash
   yarn add eslint-plugin-greenwich --dev
   ```

## Rule Details

This rule checks import statements within specified directories (e.g., "/components/") and ensures that single-word import names adhere to specific naming conventions.

### Options

This rule supports the following configuration options:

- `allowedPrefixes` (array of strings, default: `['V']`): Specifies a list of allowed prefixes for single-word import names. If provided, the rule allows import names that start with any of the specified prefixes.

- `paths` (array of strings, default: `['/components/']`): Specifies an array of directory paths where the rule should be applied. Only import statements within these paths will be checked for compliance with the rule.

## ESLint Configuration

To configure ESLint for your project, you can create or edit an ESLint configuration file (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`) in your project's root directory. Below is an example ESLint configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: ["eslint:recommended"], // Use recommended rules as a starting point
  plugins: ["greenwich"], // Add the 'greenwich' plugin
  rules: {
    "greenwich/prefix-one-word-import": [
      "error",
      {
        allowedPrefixes: ["V"], // Customize allowed prefixes
        paths: ["/components/"] // Specify the directory paths to check
      }
    ]
    // Add more rules and configurations as needed
  }
};
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how this rule works:

```javascript
// ESLint: Single-word file names in components directory must start with one of the following prefixes: ['V']
import Button from "@/components/base/Button.vue";

// ESLint: Single-word file names in components directory must start with one of the following prefixes: ['V']
import MyButton from "@/components/base/Button.vue";

// Correct: Import name "VButton" starts with an allowed prefix ['V']
import VButton from "@/components/base/Button.vue";

// Correct: Import name "DragDrop" is multi word, don't check it
import DragDrop from "@/components/base/DragDrop.vue";
```
